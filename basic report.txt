about the code : 
- import nescessary libraries 
- loading data set  
         Since we have imported tha pandas library importing the data set is rather simple by using the "read_csv()" function provided by pandas. This method converts the data into a DataFrame as well 

- visualize each collumn using scatter seperatly 
- import nescessary libraries for data pre processing 



Split Rate table : try different split rates and document the results
